    "Hello, welcome to BaseAL 👋\n",
    "\n",
    "BaseAL is a **modular framework for setting up and evaluating active learning methods** allowing you to:\n",
    "- Setup multiple sampling experiments in parallel\n",
    "- Easily add and adapt methods and parameters\n",
    "- Visualise the embedding space during training\n",
    "\n",
    "BaseAL is built on top of [bacpipe](https://github.com/bioacoustic-ai/bacpipe), developed by [Vincent Kather](https://github.com/vskode). While the active learning framework itself is modality independent (only requiring labeled embeddings), embedding generation **currently only supports audio data** 🐤\n",
    "\n",
    "*BaseAL is not an annotation tool*, it is designed to evaluate sampling methods on prelabeled datasets. You are welcome to extend this tool for annotation and adapt it for your own data pipelines 🌱\n",

    "If you have any questions, don't hesistate to get in [contact](mailto:benmcewen@outlook.com).\n"
